# Atomical 2023

Welcome to the page containing information about the Atomical Challenge, 2023. If you have somehow stumbled upon this page and are not someone already aware of it, I applaud your ingenuity. Nevertheless, please contact me immediately via [email](mailto:lancy@nosleep.pro?subject=[Atomic]%20I%20Broke%20Your%20Code). 

Please note that this information is subject to change, especially those which are inside *[square brackets]* as we will present it in a more cohesive and structured manner at a later time. As for now, I've gotta go revise for my exam tomorrow :)

## The Basics

Purpose (**Why?**):
The Atomical Challenge was created as an initiative to inspire interactivity with STEM and to provide a platform for individuals to engage in science communication. This challenge was devised as a generalization of our previous agenda to provide interested individuals an opportunity to showcase their writing skills, in the Atomic Magazine.

Procedure (**How?**): 
The Atomical Challenge is a unique competition that offers participants seven days to complete the challenge. Participants are allowed to use any resource they desire, including tools like WolframAlpha and ChatGPT to solve the challenge. (Although we will not actively encourage so - choosing the right tools is part of the challenge.) This competition is focused on communication, and participants are expected to demonstrate their ability to communicate their findings effectively. 

Timing (**When?**):
To ensure that participants do not miss academic content, the Atomical Challenge, 2023 will be conducted at the end of CQ. The exact timing of the challenge has not been decided yet.

Target Audience (**Who?**):
The challenge is primarily aimed at Fourth, Remove, and First-year students, who will (hopefully) have a bit of their structured learning time used for this challenge. Fifths and 2nd Year students are welcome to participate as well, even though we expect none to. *We especially encourage the (science) beaks to have a go as well*. After all, what way to lead but to lead by example?

**What?** and **Where?** are irrelevant, by process of elimination. ;)

## The Format

Atomical Challenge is split into three sections.

+ **Multidisciplinary**: This section features long and challenging questions that span across multiple fields of science. This section carries <20 marks>.

+ **Maths**: This section focuses on the mathematical basis that underlies most scientific principles. This section carries <20 marks>.

+ **Communication**: This section emphasizes the importance of effectively communicating one's findings. This section carries <25 marks>, with the last five marks being allocated for the presentation of answers.

Answers can be submitted in any format. And althought we don't literally mean that, we accept everything from scribbles, LaTeX documents, to entertaining vlogs (although the latter is not recommended). We value the presentation of work, and the last five marks in the Communication section are allocated for it.

### Multidisciplinary Questions

The Multidisciplinary section consists of four questions. You are, in fact, currently browsing the development version of the website we will use to distribute the questions. Simply pan your eyes to the left to discover the list of questions, though please bear in mind they've not yet been written. 

Participants can choose to attempt either one or two questions. By default, participants will attempt one question, but they can choose to attempt two questions. In such cases, the marks obtained in Section 1 will be averaged across the two chosen questions. If more than two questions are attempted, only the two highest scores will be averaged. This is to account for the limited time available for participants to attempt the questions.

These questions are designed to be independent of specific knowledge and will include explanations for concepts that are not commonly known. The questions will not follow a predictable pattern between subjects.

### Maths

Some may argue that making Maths a third of the Atomical Challenge is biased since Maths is only one of many sciences. However, we believe that Maths is a fundamental component of many scientific principles and deserves a significant portion of the challenge.

This section will not only include Maths but will also incorporate topics from other sciences like Psychology, which are challenging to incorporate into the previous section.

The Maths section carries 20 marks, equally split into applied and theoretical mathematics.

### Communication

This is the part that is integrally tied into the Atomic Magazine.
